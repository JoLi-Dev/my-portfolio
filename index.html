                <p>Delving into the world of front-end web development in the second phase of my working life was a leap that took me to the other side of my comfort zone. My interest was piqued when I was tasked with project managing the tech solution for the organisation as part of my role in a young start-up. Working with our external development team I was constantly inspired by how they were able to bring our vision to life so, when my role was made redundant, I decided to make the leap and become a developer. </p>
