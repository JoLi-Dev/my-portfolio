# My Portfolio

## Introduction

This is the first version of my portfolio. As my skill set grows, I'll continue to build it out to give it more interactive appeal. 

## Learnings and issues still to be resolved
There were so many learnings on this project, none more important than to remember that this is a learning process and not to expect to be able to do things quickly, or even know where to start in these early days. It is a huge lesson in patience and resilience that will continue for the life of this journey in front end development. 

Remember to use all the resources available and there is quite often a variety of ways to complete the same outcome. If one way and explanation is not resonating, try another resource and it may work instead. 

Using the W3 HTML and CSS checker was great to use on each section as I went to make sure I had the correct imputs. The one check I did not fix with the HTML was the warning to let me know I lacked a h1 in the document. I let this go intentionally as I was not sure what to make a h1. I did not want it to be the 'Hello' or 'my name' in the first sentence. So I started with h2 in the second section and worked down from there. 

While the focus of the assessment for this project is to see how we are going with our HTML and CSS primarily, and responsiveness was not an offical requirement. I really wanted to make it responsive. After quite some time of playing around I was still having issues with the skills section not changing to a column format once I got to a smaller mobile size. Also could not get the <hr1> and <hr5> to stay the full width of the screen once I got to a smaller mobile size also. 

As I started the course a week and a half into the program I am not yet confident to add in any Java Script. I added in a script.js page just to show I am aware that we need one in the folder, but I have not added anything in the file. I look forward to updating this once I have me head around Java Script a bit more so I can add some life to the page.

## Conclusion
This project will evolve and I hope that some time soon, with the addition of some Java script and other learnings this will be a portfolio I am proud to share with the industry.
