# My Portfolio

## Introduction

Learning all the individual pieces that make up a web page is a necessary first
step in the process of learning HTML, but one of the best ways to solidify the
concepts we've learned is to apply concepts together. In this lab, your task
will be to update `index.html` based on commented notes in the file, using what
we've learned about text formatting and displaying images.



## Conclusion

A lot of the formatting in this lab is done using CSS, or Cascading Style
Sheets, a language that defines styling for HTML. Before we can get to more
elaborate styling, though, it is important to have a strong understanding of
HTML fundamentals.

In this lab, we've tested that understanding by having you practice applying
headers, image, and paragraphs. Completing this lab means that you have a solid
foundation that we can build upon as we continue to learn about web development.

_Clap along if you feel_ you're getting the hang of HTML!
